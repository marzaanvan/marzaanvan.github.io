You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

#*Making some Italic chanegs*

It's very easy to make some texts **Bold** and other words *Italic* with Markdown.You can even [do google](https://google.com)! or try having to look into the [Jekyll-Docs][jekyll-docs]

or just go to **flying beasts** [You-Tube Channel][flying-beast] to have some cool fun.

## Time for my favourite you tube channels
1. [Flying-Beast][flying-beast]
2. [Ronnie-and-Barty][ronnie-and-barty]
3. [Casiey-Niestat][casey-niestat]
